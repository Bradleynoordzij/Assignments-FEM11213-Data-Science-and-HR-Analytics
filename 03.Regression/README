OJ and Email Data Analysis
Overview
This R script analyzes two datasets: one related to orange juice sales (oj.csv) and another concerning spam emails (spam.csv). The analysis includes generalized linear models, logistic regression, and various techniques for handling categorical variables.

Orange Juice Sales Analysis
Loading Data:

Reads orange juice sales data from a CSV file into a data frame called oj.
Displays the first and last five rows of the dataset.
Generalized Linear Model:

Fits a generalized linear model with a logarithmic link function to predict the logarithmic change in sales.
Examines coefficients and explores variations with different predictors.
Handling Categorical Variables:

Demonstrates how to create dummy variables and change the base category for categorical predictors.
Explores less restrictive regression models with interaction terms.
Taddy Naref Function:

Introduces a function (xnaref) to handle factor variables with a reference level of NA.
Applies the function to the 'brand' variable in the OJ dataset.
Sparse Model Matrix:

Uses Taddy Naref function to create separate dummies for each level, making NA the reference level.
Spam Email Analysis
Loading Data:

Reads spam email data from a CSV file into a data frame called email.
Displays the dimensions and column names of the dataset.
Logistic Regression:

Fits a logistic regression model to predict spam emails using all variables in the dataset.
Extracts and interprets coefficients for specific words in emails.
Computes odds ratios for selected words.
Prediction and Probability:

Predicts whether the first and 4000th observations are spam based on the fitted model.
Computes the probability of being spam for these observations.
Deviance and Likelihood:

Calculates and examines the deviance and null deviance.
Computes the R-squared value as a measure of model fit.
Output
Orange Juice Sales Analysis: Coefficients, regression variations, and handling categorical variables.
Spam Email Analysis: Logistic regression results, coefficients, prediction probabilities, and model fit statistics.

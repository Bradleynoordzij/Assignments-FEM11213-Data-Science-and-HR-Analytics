# Consumer Demand Elasticities Estimation

## Part 1

This R script demonstrates the estimation of consumer demand elasticities using regression models. The code is divided into sections, each addressing a specific aspect of demand analysis. For specific changes and analysis of the code check the .r file.

### Linear Regression Models

- **Simple Log-Log Regression:**
  - Reads data from "oj.csv."
  - Fits a log-log regression model using the base model.
  - Displays coefficients.

- **Log-Log Regression Controlling for Brand:**
  - Extends the model by including brand as a control variable.
  - Displays coefficients, emphasizing the partial effect of price on sales.

- **Residual Analysis:**
  - Utilizes residuals from the log price-brand regression to predict log sales.
  - Fits a model using the residuals to analyze the independent effect of price on sales.

### Crime Rate and Abortion Data Analysis

- **Abortion Data Preprocessing:**
  - Reads data from "abortion.dat" and performs data cleaning.
  - Filters out specific states and years.

- **Crime Rate Regression:**
  - Applies Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to estimate the effect of abortion rates on murder rates.
  - Conducts various model specifications, testing the importance of time and state fixed effects.

- **Cellphone and Abortion Rates:**
  - Analyzes the relationship between cellphone rates and crime rates.
  - Plots the data.

- **Lasso Regression:**
  - Uses Lasso regression to estimate causal effects of abortion rates on crime rates.

### Uncertainty Quantification with Lasso Regressions

- **Hockey Data Analysis:**
  - Applies Lasso regression to hockey data for uncertainty quantification.

## Part 2

### Orthogonal ML for Local Treatment Effects (LTE)

- **Orthogonal ML Function:**
  - Defines an R function for Orthogonal ML to estimate local treatment effects.

- **Orthogonal ML and Abortion Access:**
  - Applies Orthogonal ML to estimate the effect of abortion access on crime rates.

### Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)

- **Health Insurance Effect Analysis:**
  - Explores the heterogeneous treatment effects of health insurance on various health outcomes.
  - Utilizes descriptive, program, and survey data.

### Consumer Demand Estimation and Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

- **Beer Demand Analysis:**
  - Reads beer-related data.
  - Estimates demand elasticities using Lasso and Orthogonal ML.
  - Visualizes elasticity distribution.

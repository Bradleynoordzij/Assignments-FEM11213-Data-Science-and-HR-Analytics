Semiconductor Failure Prediction and Web Browsing Analysis
Semiconductor Failure Prediction
Loading and Fitting Generalized Linear Model
Reads semiconductor failure data from a CSV file into a dataset named SC.
Fits a generalized linear model (glm) to predict the binary outcome variable FAIL, using all variables in the SC dataset.
Model Summary and R-squared Calculation
Calculates the R-squared value using the deviance and null deviance.
Summarizes the fitted model to extract coefficients.
Demonstrates the in-sample R-squared calculation using the formula.
Out-of-Sample Prediction Experiment
Defines custom functions (deviance and R2) for calculating deviance and R-squared.
Conducts a K-fold cross-validation experiment (default K=10) to assess model performance out-of-sample.
Plots the boxplot of R-squared values and saves it as a PNG file.
Calculates the average R-squared values for the K-fold experiment.
Test with 20 Folds
Conducts the K-fold experiment with 20 folds and assesses the average R-squared values.
Concludes the robustness of results, noting that the model predicts worse than the null model.
Forward Stepwise Regression
Performs forward stepwise regression until the AIC decreases.
Prints the number of selected coefficients.
Backward Stepwise Regression (Caution)
Attempts backward stepwise regression but notes potential issues due to multicollinearity and overfitting.
Warns about the extended runtime and estimates of p-values on an overfit model.
Web Browsing Analysis
Data Preparation
Reads web browsing data from a CSV file into a dataset named web.
Converts site and machine IDs to factors with appropriate levels.
Creates a sparse matrix (xweb) to represent website visit percentages per machine.
Top Websites Analysis
Calculates the total percentage of visits for each website.
Identifies the top websites based on total percentage and displays the results.
LASSO Regression for Spending Prediction
Reads spending data from a CSV file into a matrix named yspend.
Runs a LASSO path plot and saves it as a PNG file.
Conducts K-fold cross-validation for LASSO and plots the results, saving as a PNG file.
Extracts coefficients for the minimum cross-validation error.
AIC for Model Selection
Demonstrates the use of Aikaike's Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection.
Displays the first six AIC values for the LASSO model.

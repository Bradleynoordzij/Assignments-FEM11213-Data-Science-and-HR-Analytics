Web Browsers Data Analysis
Overview
This R script analyzes data related to web browsers stored in a CSV file (web-browsers.csv). The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, statistical measures, bootstrapping, and logistic regression techniques.

Tasks Performed
Loading Data:

Reads web browser data from a CSV file into a data frame called browser.
Data Exploration:

Displays the dimensions (rows and columns) of the dataset.
Shows the first six rows of the dataset.
Descriptive Statistics:

Computes and displays the mean, variance, and standard deviation of online spending.
Bootstrapping:

Creates bootstrap samples and calculates the standard deviation, demonstrating the reliability of the technique.
Generates histograms of bootstrap sample means.
Fits logistic regression models to bootstrap samples and calculates covariances.
Logistic Regression:

Fits a logistic regression model using the original dataset, estimating coefficients and displaying summary statistics.
Bootstrap Regression:

Performs bootstrap regressions, storing estimated coefficients.
False Discovery Rate Control:

Implements the Benjamini-Hochberg algorithm to control the False Discovery Rate.
Plots and saves visualizations of the algorithm's results.
Output
Descriptive Statistics: Mean, variance, and standard deviation.
Bootstrap Analysis: Histograms, bootstrap standard deviations, and regression coefficients.
Logistic Regression: Estimated coefficients and summary statistics.
False Discovery Rate Control: Plots demonstrating FDR control.

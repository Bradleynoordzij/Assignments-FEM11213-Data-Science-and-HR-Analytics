Overview
Dataset Loading and Exploration
Loads the fgl dataset from the MASS package.
Displays the dimensions (214 rows and 10 columns) and the first two rows of the dataset.
KNN Plotting
Creates and saves different plots for variables (RI, Al, Na, Mg, Ba, Si) against the glass type.
Saves the plots as a PNG file.
KNN Implementation
Scales the features of the fgl dataset using the scale function.
Uses the knn function from the class library to perform K-nearest neighbors classification.
Conducts three tests with different numbers of rows (10, 20, 10) to assess KNN predictability.
Displays the results showing predicted classes for nearest 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 neighbors.
Classification Example with German Credit Data
Reads and preprocesses the German Credit Data.
Creates dummy variables and levels for categorical variables.
Selects specific columns for analysis.
Defines the xnaref and naref functions for handling missing values in factors.
Applies LASSO penalized multinomial regression using the gamlr package.
Plots the regularization path, out-of-sample prediction performance, and CV-min.
Analysis and Visualizations
Displays AIC values for model selection.
Identifies the optimal lambda (min AIC) and counts the number of selected coefficients.
Calculates the out-of-sample R-squared and displays the underlying default probabilities.
Creates a boxplot of default probabilities for true defaults and non-defaults.
Classification Rule
Implements and tests classification rules with varying costs and evaluates false positives and false negatives.
ROC Curve
Generates in-sample and out-of-sample ROC curves.
Plots ROC curves and saves them as a PNG file.
Mosaic Plot
Creates a mosaic plot to visualize the relationship between credit history and loan outcomes.
Demonstrates that default rates decrease for worse credit history due to the limited availability of large loans.
Multinomial Logistic Regression
Applies LASSO penalized multinomial regression to the fgl dataset.
Plots the regularization path and displays OOS deviance across CV folds.
Extracts coefficients and calculates the difference in coefficients for the predictor Mg between classes WinNF and WinF.
Probability Prediction and Visualization
Predicts probabilities for each class based on the multinomial logistic regression model.
Creates a bar plot to visualize predicted probabilities for the true class of each observation.
